The Secret of Web Page Layout (2): Floating and Positioning
===

Through the `display` property introduced in the previous article, we can already complete the layout of the web page. For a specific element, we can still continue to adjust the display position of the element through the `float` and `position` attributes.

## Floating

Floating means placing a specific element at the left or right of the container, while all other elements continue to be arranged in the remaining space according to the container's layout settings. We can use the `float` property to set whether an element is floating.
